### In short
Automated Java code grading system for university professors.

### Description
I have developed an automated grading system for my lab TA position that is used to help with grading assignments for HPU's Java courses. Some of the major features of the application include: automatic syncing with GitHub, runs custom test cases for different assignments, manages assignments that still needed to be graded, organizes the requirements to help grading and generates a master student analytics spreadsheet.
